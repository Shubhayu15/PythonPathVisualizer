# PythonPathVisualizer
 This project is a Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer built using Python's tkinter library. It provides an interactive graphical interface to visualize and compare the performance of three popular pathfinding algorithms: A* Algorithm, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Dijkstra's Algorithm. Users can set up a grid, define start and end points, add barriers, and generate different map layouts (e.g., empty grid, random noise, or a recursive division maze). The visualizer highlights the pathfinding process in real-time, showing the open and closed nodes, and finally displays the shortest path (if one exists).
